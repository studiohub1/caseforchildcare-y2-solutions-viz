1,Public-private partnerships,"“Tri-Share is a great tool for employers. When businesses utilize it, they experience significant cost savings from retention and recruitment costs.”",6,Marcus Keech,"Director of Government Affairs, Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce"
3,Employee advocacy,"""We are an organization that has many departments that can service both our business and on-site childcare center. We have a finance department to help our Childcare Director with her budget. We have the security department to deal with entrance/door security. We have an IT department for internet support. Many businesses already have this infrastructure and a childcare center is like another department that they can serve.""",8,Loryn Duke,"Communications Director, Steamboat Resort"
4,Care culture,"""We learned our people were calling in sick for themselves when they had a childcare issue. In their minds, there was a stigma associated with having childcare issues that they wanted to avoid.""",9,Danelle McCusker Rees,"President, Human Resources & Operations Training, UPS"
4,Care culture,“Our care policies help us get rockstar talent. Our attrition is low because people come and they stay with us. We don’t see a motherhood or parenthood penalty at Etsy.”,10,Josh Silverman,"CEO, Etsy"
4,Care culture,"“Until we actually look at care from a holistic perspective and make sure we are supporting and encouraging people in creating a culture where they feel empowered to prioritize their childcare needs, then the tactical solutions won’t make that much of a difference. Are we creating the culture where employees feel that they have the agency to take the benefits that are available to them? If not, these benefits won’t matter.""",11,Hillary Hittner,"Co-Founder, LUMO"
5,Business partnerships,"""Government spending on childcare benefits is effectively building a workforce. Employers advocating for government benefits for childcare is one of the most powerful ways to get movement and further support needed.""",12,Siran Cao,"CEO & Co-Founder, Mirza"
6,Subsidized care,"“One of our employees who received a childcare subsidy immediately found more reliable childcare and applied to be promoted from a shift leader to a manager role. Her boss went on maternity leave this year and she stepped in as interim shop manager. We’ve now promoted her to run her own shop. We have given her the tools to balance supporting her family financially, providing quality care for her child, and moving forward in a career she is great at. That is the power of investing in care.""",13,Molly Moon,"Founder & CEO, Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream"
7,Asset mapping,"""We’ve continued to hear from our business leaders that many of them are trying to address childcare directly in their communities and don't know how to do that. We work to help them understand how to address childcare needs for the business, employees, and the community. We approach this from an equitable and community-minded perspective, helping them find the right solution and then understanding the long-term financial implications and feasibility of that solution.”",14,Nicole Riehl,"President & CEO, EPIC"
8,Care campaign,"""The more we can learn from examples of employers customizing care benefits for their specific employees, the more we can take them to public policy leaders and create solutions through customization.""",15,Patrice Cromwell,"Former Vice President of the Center for Economic Opportunity, Annie E. Casey Foundation"
11,Care leader collaboration,"""We are not a childcare business. We had no expectations that we would know how to open or operate a childcare center, but there are so many resources out there to help you. Everyone wants to share their successes and toolkits. There are so many resources out there to help you understand what the process looks like, how it's feasible, and then help you get up and running to be successful.""",8,Loryn Duke,"Communications Director, Steamboat Resort"
11,Care leader collaboration,"""When we started thinking we could open a childcare center, we started calling everyone we knew in the space to ask how they got started- We got on the phone with Patagonia, our local County Commissioner who had experience with childcare, we even called local childcare centers to ask how they got started. Everyone was so generous with their time and advice and it helped us understand the first steps.""",16,Morgan Bast,"Marketing Director, Steamboat Resort"
12,Benefits cliff consideration,"“Never decline people from climbing the ladder of economic prosperity. We want to increase MIchigan's Tri-Share to include a sliding scale so we can get rid of the benefits cliff. Right now, as somebody is making more money, they become ineligible for the full third of the benefit from the state. So, we hear people are declining promotions and raises because then they will get kicked out of the program.”",6,Marcus Keech,"Director of Government Affairs, Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce"
13,CHIPS Act grants,"""We’re going to invest over $100M in manufacturing capabilities for 100K jobs. We need to attract and retain a workforce moving forward.

We're focused on helping build facilitities that will serve contingent workers to ensure they have access to discounted programs. We think this will help us attract the workforce of tomorrow and we can care for the future generation of innovators while we’re doing this.""",17,Amber Wiseley,"Vice President, Total Rewards, Intel"
14,ROI measurement,"""We tried to make our pitch as metric-bound as possible, that's what spoke to our decision-makers: the number of employees who have kids, the stats on our regional childcare desert, the stats on those who are leaving our workforce, and more. We Built a toolkit to convince executives and show the long-term ROI on how these benefits could pay off.""",16,Morgan Bast,"Marketing Director, Steamboat Resort"
14,ROI measurement,"""We decided we wanted to experiment with a solution for our people.  One of the most critical components of starting a new program is getting early buy-in from your executive leadership team. We asked for a little bit of funding to see what we could learn. We ran a pilot which gave us the ability to build the business case for our backup childcare program through data, statistics, and a tangible ROI.”",9,Danelle McCusker Rees,"President, Human Resources & Operations Training, UPS"
15,Coverage bonus,"""We were able to showcase that a lot of our non-caregiver workforce was still supportive of childcare benefits because they were impacted by caregivers when they had to leave because of lack of childcare.""",8,Loryn Duke,"Communications Director, Steamboat Resort"
19,Employee resource group,"“Our care ERG is something that all of our employees can participate in, including frontline and part-time employees. It's a really great option to hear the feedback from what people are looking for, what they need, and then we can provide support. They've also been able to advocate for some additional resources, like a caregiving coach who can help look for care options in your area that fit your needs.”",19,Theresa Roma,"Senior Product Manager, Wellness Solutions, Guardian Life Insurance"
19,Employee resource group,"""The first step for us was creating a business resource group for women in operations. This gave us the ability to have candid conversations and build trust with our people. We heard that our people, especially women, believed they had to choose between having children or having a career; in their minds, they couldn’t have both.""",9,Danelle McCusker Rees,"President, Human Resources & Operations Training, UPS"
19,Employee resource group,"""One of the most important factors of getting on-site daycare across the finish line was passion from our employees. It was really a group of parents within the organization who started advocating for this and were relentless about it. It was almost impossible for our leadership to ignore the employees saying that childcare was super important.""",8,Loryn Duke,"Communications Director, Steamboat Resort"
19,Employee resource group,"""We listen to the needs of our people by establishing a Parent ERG where we have a direct forum where we get feedback on programs that will be meaningful to people.""",20,Kate Clifford,"Chief Human Resources Officer, North America, Accenture"
21,Pilots,"“We started small at one facility with a six-month pilot for an emergency or backup childcare program. We found 77% of our bookings during the pilot were happening within a 48 hour period, meaning they were true emergencies. We really wanted to solve for the gap in primary care. Then the ROI comes into play because when someone can't show up at work, there's operational pressure. This pilot proved to release that pressure, providing consistency and stability in our workforce.  We avoided over 120 absences and our retention went from 69% to an incredible 96%!”",9,Danelle McCusker Rees,"President, Human Resources & Operations Training, UPS"
22,Resource pooling,“One of the biggest challenges in our region is the lack of affordable child care slots because of teacher recruitment issues.

23,On-ramps,"“If I had a magic wand, I would go back in time and pick a different career. Hospital-based audiology was super demanding as a parent and I was forced to leave the workforce. The return on investment wasn’t what I imagined. It’s sad to say this because I love what I do.”",22,Erica,Former Clinical Audiologist
24,Back-up care,"""Start by listening to the caregivers in your employee base and really understanding what type of support they need and want. We have learned through our research that the vast majority of frontline workers rely on friends and family to care for their children and many are happy with this arrangement. But their biggest complaint was needing a more resilient option when that care falls through, particularly at the very last minute. And so we were able to design targeted, reliable back-up support that meets their specific trust and safety criteria .""",23,Olivia Rosenthal,"Co-Founder, Patch Caregiving"
27,Employee assistance programs,"""Our business is our talent. Keeping our talent is important. If our people aren’t out serving clients, we don’t stay in business.""",20,Kate Clifford,"Chief Human Resources Officer, North America, Accenture"
28,Flexible work,"“The draw for doing gig work is the flexibility. A set schedule is hard with all the different activities my kids have. It’s nearly impossible to get everything done. With gig work, I can go to a doctor’s appointment or take personal appointments. Worst case scenario, I can throw kids in the back seat while I drive for DoorDash.”",24,Kiana Wang,Gig Worker
29,On-site childcare,"""Accessibility to care was the primary issue in our community. Now that we've opened an near-site child care center, we're investigating the affordability challenge. The key was for us to start somewhere and not worry about solving every issue at first.""",16,Morgan Bast,"Marketing Director, Steamboat Resort"
29,On-site childcare,"""We are an organization that has many departments that can service both our business and on-site childcare center. We have a finance department to help our Childcare Director with her budget. We have the security department to deal with door blocking mechanisms. We have an IT department when the internet goes down. Many businesses already have this infrastructure and a childcare center is like another department that they can serve.""",8,Loryn Duke,"Communications Director, Steamboat Resort"
29,On-site childcare,"""OnsiteKids develops and operates on-site child care centers specifically for frontline workers. We've baked flexibility and affordability into this model so that employers who have been scared away by Child Care 1.0 (expensive, inflexible, and outdated) can actually take off and pilot our Child Care 2.0 approach - start small, learn fast, and grow with the workforce.”",26,Carmi Medoff,"Founder & CEO, Onsite Kids"
33,Diversity metrics,"“Childcare supports are not an equal benefit, but an equitable benefit. Many employers we've we've worked with oftentimes see that it’s women and employees from households of lower incomes who are disproportionately impacted. These are the people who are lacking the ability to stay in the workforce, be promoted, or take leadership positions. When we look at the data, childcare is actually inhibiting many of these diversity goals that companies want to pursue around diversity, equity, and inclusion.”",14,Nicole Riehl,"President & CEO, EPIC"
35,FFN care,"""I've seen companies acknowledge and offer stipends and subsidies to pay for family, friend, & neighbor (FFN) care, which is a critical component for frontline workers. Government programs already acknowledge this—there's only a minority of states that don’t allow you to use vouchers for FFN.""",12,Siran Cao,"CEO & Co-Founder, Mirza"
35,FFN care,"“We encourage our employer partners to adopt a flexible and inclusive approach to care benefits. For those providing stipends or allowances, we recommend empowering employees to use the funds in ways that best meet their unique care needs—even beyond childcare. It’s about supporting what truly helps their families thrive.”",27,Bobby Isaacson,"Vice President Of Sales, Upwards"
36,Employee survey,"""During the pandemic, women were dropping out of our workforce at a shocking rate, and next thing we knew it became national headlines impacting most companies and our economy. We wanted to figure out where our employees were going and why employee absenteeism was increasing.""",9,Danelle McCusker Rees,"President, Human Resources & Operations Training, UPS"
37,Manager training,"“Until we actually look at the implementation on benefits from a holistic perspective, the tactical solutions won't make a difference. Ensure you're supporting and encouraging leaders and manager to create a culture where they feel empowered to prioritize their childcare needs and support others with those responsibilities.”
",11,Hillary Hittner,"Co-Founder, LUMO"
38,Business councils,"“Early Matters Greater Austin is a coalition of business leaders using their voice to advocate for increased investment in quality, affordable child care and to promote family-friendly workplace policies, recognizing that access to childcare is an economic development issue.”",28,Brooke Freeland,"Early Education Policy Consultant, United Way of Greater Austin"
2,Public policy,"""I worked very hard to lobby the state of Washington and was involved in the organization that wrote the bill that created the paid family leave policy. The responsibility of impact-driven leadership is to be lobbying the government to do what you think is right.""",13,Molly Moon,"Founder & CEO, Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream"
25,Coaching & mentorship,"""We're constantly communicating with our Moon crew members when they're ready for a promotion. We love to grow management from within.""",13,Molly Moon,"Founder & CEO, Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream"
17,Health insurance,"""I wrote a business plan for an ice cream store that would put workers first by providing living wages and free health insurance. I began lobbying for tax credits to help with health insurance. When I got pregnant, I realized we needed family benefits.”",13,Molly Moon,"Founder & CEO, Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream"
